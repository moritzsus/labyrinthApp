# labyrinthApp

Android Studio Project for an app which genererates random labyrinths. <br>
The player has to navigate through the labyrinth by tilting the phone. <br>
There is also an option to use an MPU6050 Sensor as remote control. The connection is handled with MQTT. <br>
There are 5 levels and the best runs get saved in an SQLite database.
